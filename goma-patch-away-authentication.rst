Goma and Buildbarn
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This follows the `goma and bromite`_ documentation,
to use `goma`'s RBE proxy to the standard bb-deployment.
We will follow the sequence, but make some adjustments to use `Buildbarn` instead of `buildgrid`.
The text below is mostly expansion on what is done for `bromite`,
but using the official tools for dependencies, the setup is explained well in Kubala's `buildgrid setup guide`_.

Though I did fail, and the section `paths diverge`_ goes into the differences,
and my trouble-shooting following that.

.. _goma and buildgrid: https://kubala.github.io/docs/setting-up-goma

Setup
=====

We checkout out goma server 0.13, as used by the guide.

.. TODO

Modifications
=============

We cannot use the official authenticaion flow,
so we patch the `server` to strip out authentication,
and then patch a script in the `client`.
Thankfully it is easy to recompile the `server`,
and the client can be downloaded as pre-built binaries with driver scripts,
and we only need to modify those scripts.

Paths Diverge
=============

Compiler proxy crashes on our authentication:

But with my old access token from a valid service account it seems okay

Strace
------

Maybe it is tilde expansion?::

    1831008 write(131, "Log file created at: 2023/08/18 11:35:14\nRunning on machine: white\nRunning duration (h:mm:ss): 0:00:00\nLog line format: [IWEF]yyyymmdd hh:mm:ss.uuuuuu threadid file:line] msg\nF20230818 11:35:14.166232 1831008 http_init.cc:151] Check failed: ReadFileToString(FLAGS_HTTP_AUTHORIZATION_FILE.c_str(), &auth_header) ~/.debug_goma_auth_file : you need http Authorization header in ~/.debug_goma_auth_file or unset GOMA_HTTP_AUTHORIZATION_FILE\n", 437) = 437

Switch over to `/home/nils`:
Then running the singular `compiler_proxy` works!

Start the daemons
-----------------

Still gives a failed http access to the backend
