Goma and Buildbarn
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This follows the `goma and bromite`_ documentation,
to use `goma`'s RBE proxy to the standard bb-deployment.
We will follow the sequence, but make some adjustments to use `Buildbarn` instead of `buildgrid`.
The text below is mostly expansion on what is done for `bromite`,
but using the official tools for dependencies, the setup is explained well in Kubala's `buildgrid setup guide`_.

Though I did fail, and the section `paths diverge`_ goes into the differences,
and my trouble-shooting following that.

Setup
=====

We checkout out `goma server` `origin/main`.
There have been many recent changes from people working with various `RBE` projects.

.. TODO

Modifications
=============

We cannot use the official authentication flow,
so we patch the `server` to strip out authentication,
and then patch a script in the `client`.
Thankfully it is easy to recompile the `server`,
and the client can be downloaded as pre-built binaries with driver scripts,
and we only need to modify those scripts.

Paths Diverge
=============

Compiler proxy crashes on our authentication:

But with my old access token from a valid service account it seems okay

Strace

Maybe it is tilde expansion?::

    1831008 write(131, "Log file created at: 2023/08/18 11:35:14\nRunning on machine: white\nRunning duration (h:mm:ss): 0:00:00\nLog line format: [IWEF]yyyymmdd hh:mm:ss.uuuuuu threadid file:line] msg\nF20230818 11:35:14.166232 1831008 http_init.cc:151] Check failed: ReadFileToString(FLAGS_HTTP_AUTHORIZATION_FILE.c_str(), &auth_header) ~/.debug_goma_auth_file : you need http Authorization header in ~/.debug_goma_auth_file or unset GOMA_HTTP_AUTHORIZATION_FILE\n", 437) = 437

Switch over to `/home/nils`:
Then running the singular `compiler_proxy` works!

    $ /home/nils/bin/gits/depot_tools/.cipd_bin/compiler_proxy

Start the daemons
-----------------

Still gives a failed http access to the backend

Check that the host is configured::

    $ /home/nils/bin/gits/depot_tools/.cipd_bin/compiler_proxy --print-server-host
    localhost:5050

It seems that mainly `auth.py` uses the `/cxx-compiler-service` endpoint
and we do patch it all away.
Double check that all versions are patched, to avoid unexpected PATH traversal or whatever.::

    locate goma_auth.py | xargs wc -l
      5 /CAS/bin/goma_auth.py
      # [Editor's Note] Seems like I have deleted the android version here.
      5 /CAS/chromium/src/third_party/depot_tools/.cipd_bin/goma_auth.py
      5 /CAS/chromium/src/third_party/depot_tools/.cipd_bin/android/goma_auth.py
      5 /CAS/depot_tools/.cipd_bin/goma_auth.py
      5 /CAS/depot_tools/.cipd_bin/android/goma_auth.py
      5 /CAS/goma/client/client/goma_auth.py
      5 /CAS/goma/client/out/Release/goma_auth.py
      5 /home/nils/bin/gits/depot_tools/.cipd_bin/goma_auth.py
      5 /home/nils/bin/gits/depot_tools/.cipd_bin/android/goma_auth.py

But there is still some code in the `goma client` to access this.
And get something back.

The `server is meant to provide this endpoint in `frontend.go::Register`
And our patches should make sure that we send something to "authorize" the `client`.

But the problem "bad gateway" indicates that it does not reach the `server`.

Remaining Authentication
------------------------

This ping can be done manually with `curl`::

    $ curl -XPOST \
        --user-agent 'compiler-proxy built by chrome-bot at 3435fce1653aa1d611c2834901561be7e6ccfab0@1686192619 on 2023-06-08T03:08:16.790750Z ' \
        'localhost:5050/cxx-compiler-service/ping'
    ok

But it fails without the port.
So some environment variable setup within the `client` loses the port.

It is good to know that the `rbe_proxy` operates when we hit it.
But maybe the error is in the communication with the `http proxy`,
which does not receive, or does not propagate, the ping.

Setting `GOMA_URL_PATH_PREFIX` to include the port
fails quickly with error 400: bad request.

Note that `wireshark` says that the original request is sent to destination port `19080`,
so the bad gateway seems the be the `http_proxy`.

Try to torubleshoot the http proxy individually
